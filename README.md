My experimental project for self-studying Ruby language.

An IRC bot to perform basic operations in channels.

Current implementation (first commit) has nickname and server/port information hardcoded. This will be fixed when the code gains more functionality.

Simply compile and wait until connection completes. You can use IRC commands such as JOIN, PRIVMSG, PART etc. to use IRC services.

This experience might be improved later.
